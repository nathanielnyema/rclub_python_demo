This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)

combos <- combn(colnames(iris)[1:4],2)
p = list()
for (i in 1:dim(combos)[2]){
  p[[i]] <- ggplot(iris, aes_string(x=combos[1,i], y=combos[2,i], color="Species")) + geom_point(size=2)
}
do.call(grid.arrange,p)


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
